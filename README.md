# StreamRaiders Assist
Officially Unofficial Companion for the StreamRaiders Twitch Minigame

## What is this?
Simply put, StreamRaiders Assist is an unofficial Companion Bot for Discord, that provides non-advantageous functions for Streamers streaming and/or playing [Stream Raiders](https://streamraiders.com/game/)

## DISCLAIMER
```
StreamRaiders Assist is not sponsored by, endorsed by, partnered with or otherwise affiliated with StreamRaiders, Stream Captain or any other parties directly or indirectly involved with the Development or Deployment of the StreamRaiders Game, or other services provided by Stream Captain. Furthermore, this project is fan made. Permission was sought but not directly approved. This means at any time the service may be withdrawn, at the request from Stream Captain. All assets used in StreamRaiders Assist are publicly available, or were provided by Stream Captain staff members as a gesture of goodwill.

## Functions

```YAML
Units: See a list of all units in your discord server, and view information on specific units
Enemies: See a list of base-game enemies in your discord server, and view information on specific enemies

Epic Placement: If you have the EPIC options, you receive a neat little embed in your discord server whenever somebody places an Epic unit on your battlefield
```

# Roadmap:

First point of call is to make the functions that the bot code can rely on

Second is to make listeners for the Twitch side of things, for Epic Placement and battle plans being started, or ready to start. 

Third is to create Discord listeners so that the bot can interact with commands issued by users. These would be for Unit Help, and maybe eventually Skin Viewers, depending on public availability of assets.
